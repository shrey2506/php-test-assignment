# Candidate Testing Application

This is a Laravel-based candidate testing application built as a skill assessment assignment for RoyalApps. The application integrates with the Candidate Testing API to authenticate users and manage authors and books. It also includes an extra bonus featureâ€”a custom Artisan command to add a new author via the CLI.

## Features

### 1. Authentication (Login)
- **Login Page:**  
  Users can log in using their email and password. Upon successful authentication via the Candidate Testing API, an access token is stored in the session.  
  *Includes both HTML5 and JavaScript-based form validation.*

### 2. Dashboard
- **User Profile & Logout:**  
  After logging in, the dashboard displays the logged-in user's first and last name along with a logout link.
- **Authors Table:**  
  Displays a list of authors fetched from the API in a table format. Each author has a "View" button to access detailed information.
- **Add New Book Link:**  
  Provides a link to a form for creating a new book.

### 3. Authors Management
- **Author Detail Page:**  
  Shows detailed information about a single author, including their biography and a list of books.
- **Conditional Delete Author:**  
  If an author has no associated books, a "Delete Author" button is displayed. Otherwise, the deletion option is not shown.

### 4. Books Management
- **Delete Book:**  
  On the author detail page, each book has a "Delete Book" button to allow individual deletion.
- **Create New Book:**  
  A dedicated form lets users create a new book. The form includes:
  - An Authors dropdown (populated via the API)
  - Fields for title, release date, description, ISBN, format, and number of pages  
  *Basic form validation is implemented on this page.*

### 5. Extra Bonus Feature
- **Artisan Command to Add a New Author:**  
  A custom Artisan command (`php artisan author:add`) is available to add a new author via the CLI. The command prompts for the necessary details and sends a POST request to the API.
